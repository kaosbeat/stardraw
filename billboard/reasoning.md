- I took all the records from the Belgium database with a connection to Gent or Ghent or one of it's communities (Gentbtugge, ...) (79564 records)  (1.filter.,py)
- from this list, I extracted all the first names 2.filtercsvfornames.py
- count all characters in list 3.countchars.py
- calculate proportion of the billboard ascii chart, using square characters
- proportion of needed characters vs 1cm/1cm chars avail;able space on a 730*570cm billboard = 541520/416100 = 1,301417929
- >>> 950 x 742 character
- every char needs 6x6 px to be shown on the billboard so we need  -w 5700 -h 4452 pixels
- every character on the billboard will be about 0.768cm tall
- generate the image (eyeparser.py)
- convert the image : /opt/inkscape -w 5700 -h 4452 --export-filename=outputscaled.pdf output.svg
