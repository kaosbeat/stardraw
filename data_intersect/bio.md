Data intersect study is a research project that aims to create with "found data". Much like found footage movies, the found data is reassambled into new data compositions. Kasper Jordaens writes code to do the search and the cut and paste work for the montages. The result ranges from graphical output to interactive sonifications. The study tries to understand the stories behind the data, questions how or why the data was left for finding. The meaning of data can shift dramatically when presented in a different way. To reconnect people to the vast scale of data use, Kasper makes data tangible. Hacking old printers and pen plotters  using them as interactive drawing tools that physically dig into data and slowing down data processing back to the human scale. The resultinmg body of work is presented in an installation where even more of the data will be used and shown in projections during a live performance where the modular synth will play a central role in creating soundscapes that reflect on data capitalism/indsutry
